# Situation
My client wants to see if it is worth monitoring electrical energy in order to optimze costs and consumption behaviour.
I was given a data sample for one month in order to extract insights and enable him to take the decision. 

# Task
Opened data
Processed time series
Calculated before and after consumption
Eextracted insights into seaborn darshboards

# Trends 
The more hours the more active the larger consumption.
At the begining of the week and end of the week, there are more ative hours and therefore consumption
The worst the weather the higher kwH consumption.

#Conclusions 
Not big differences spotted between situation with app and before app, most propbably because consumption behaviour was much the same and data was only processed for 1 month.
Nevertheless differences show clear benefits of using monitoring app in order to optimize costs and consumption behaviour.
The short answer is Yes use the monitoring app as on a longer term it may be even more usefull.
